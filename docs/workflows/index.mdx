LlamaIndex Workflows are a library for event-driven programming in JavaScript and TypeScript.
It provides a simple and lightweight orchestration solution for building complex workflows with minimal boilerplate.

It combines [event-driven](./api-reference/type-aliases/WorkflowEvent) programming, [async context](./api-reference/type-aliases/WorkflowContext) and [streaming](./api-reference/classes/WorkflowStream) to create a flexible and efficient way to handle data processing tasks.

The essential concepts of Workflows are:

- **Events**: are the core building blocks of Workflows. They represent data that flows through the system.
- **Handlers**: are functions that process events and can produce new events.
- **Context**: is the environment in which events are processed. It provides access to the event stream and allows sending new events.
- **Workflow**: is the collection of events, handlers, and context that define the processing logic.

## Getting Started

```shell
npm i @llamaindex/workflow-core

yarn add @llamaindex/workflow-core

pnpm add @llamaindex/workflow-core

bun add @llamaindex/workflow-core

deno add npm:@llamaindex/workflow-core
```

## First Example

With [workflowEvent](./api-reference/type-aliases/WorkflowEvent) and [createWorkflow](./api-reference/functions/createWorkflow), you can create a simple workflow that processes events.

For example, imagine you want to create a workflow that uses OpenAI to generate a response to a user's message.

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { createWorkflow, workflowEvent } from "@llamaindex/workflow-core";

const main = async () => {
  const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  });

  const startEvent = workflowEvent<string>();
  const stopEvent = workflowEvent<string>();

  const workflow = createWorkflow();

  workflow.handle([startEvent], async (event) => {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: event.data }],
    });

    return stopEvent.with(response.choices[0].message.content ?? "");
  });

  workflow.handle([stopEvent], (event) => {
    console.log("Response:", event.data);
  });

  const { sendEvent } = workflow.createContext();
  sendEvent(startEvent.with("Hello, Workflows!"));
};

void main().catch(console.error);
```

From here, the sky is the limit. You can implement [branching](./common_patterns/branching.mdx), [looping](./common_patterns/loops.mdx), [human-in-the-loop](./common_patterns/human_in_the_loop.mdx), [map-reduce](./common_patterns/map_reduce.mdx), and more!

## Architecture

Workflows are built around components like events, steps/handlers, context, and more. Learn more about these components [here](./api-reference/).


## Deployment

Workflows are designed to be run anywhere. Deploy in a server, a lambda function, an edge runtime, or a cloudflare function!

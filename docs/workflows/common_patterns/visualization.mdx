title: Visualizing Workflows
description: Draw workflow graphs in the browser with the workflow-viz package
---

LlamaIndex Workflows can be visualized as interactive graphs in the browser. This helps you understand event flow and handler connections at a glance.

### When to use visualization

- Debug complex routing between events and handlers
- Explain workflow behavior to teammates and users
- Build interactive demos and documentation pages

## How to use withDrawing

The `withDrawing` middleware decorates a workflow with drawing capabilities exposing a `draw` method that renders the workflow in a HTML container.

To install the visualization package, run:

```bash
npm install @llamaindex/workflow-viz
```

Wrap your workflow with `withDrawing` and write handlers as usual. Make sure to add `debugLabel` to your events to use them as node names in the graph:

```ts
import { createWorkflow, workflowEvent } from "@llamaindex/workflow-core";
import { withDrawing } from "@llamaindex/workflow-viz";

// Define events (debug labels are used for node names in the graph)
const startEvent = workflowEvent<string>({ debugLabel: "start" });
const doneEvent = workflowEvent<string>({ debugLabel: "done" });

// Decorate your workflow to enable drawing
const workflow = withDrawing(createWorkflow());

workflow.handle([startEvent], (_ctx, start) => {
  return doneEvent.with(`Hello ${start.data}`);
});
```

See a complete example of a branching workflow using `withDrawing` in the [`visualization`](../../../demo/visualization) demo.

## Render in the browser with draw

Workflows decorated by `withDrawing` gain a `.draw(container, options)` method for rendering the graph to the page. Rendering uses [Sigma](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js) under the hood and supports [its settings](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/blob/13062dc5be4f876d7c188411b120bb5a3a0be6f4/packages/sigma/src/settings.ts#L30).

```ts
import { workflow } from "./workflow";

const container = document.getElementById("app") as HTMLElement;

// Optional settings:
// - layout: "force" | "none" (defaults to "force")
// - Any Sigma renderer setting can be passed as well, e.g. `defaultEdgeColor`
workflow.draw(container, {
  layout: "force",
  defaultEdgeColor: "#999",
});
```

Notes:

- `layout: "force"` applies a force-directed layout automatically (default). Set `layout: "none"` to disable it.
- You can pass any Sigma renderer settings in the options object to customize appearance and interactions.
- The `draw` method is rendering the workflow as defined by the handlers you registered. If you call `handle` after `draw`, the graph won't be automatically updated.

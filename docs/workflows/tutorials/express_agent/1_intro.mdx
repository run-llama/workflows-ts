# Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through the process of building an Express Agent.

We will:

- Create a workflow with a basic tool-calling agent loop.
- Add state to the workflow, so that we can track the state of the agent.
- Add human-in-the-loop to the workflow. Some tools are important enough that we want to ask a human to confirm and review actions.
- Deploy the workflow to a simple express server.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and Node.js.
- Basic knowledge of the command line.
- An OpenAI API key or OpenAI-compatible service
